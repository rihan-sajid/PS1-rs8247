1a. The algorithmic complexity of the left rectangle rule is N^4

1b. By transforming the convolution of rho and G into the Fourier domain, it can be shown that 
the problem is simplified into a simple multiplication of the transformed rho and G functions. 
We can then take the inverse Fourier transform to get the convolved function back into real 
space. The algorithmic complexity of the FFT on the convolution Since the problem is not periodic, 
like the problem states, we need to have periodic/Von Neumann boundary conditions.
